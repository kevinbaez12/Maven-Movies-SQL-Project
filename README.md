THE SITUATION
    The company's insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company's underwriters need some updated information from us before they can     issue us a new policy
    
THE OBJECTIVE
    Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database to answer the underwritersâ€™ questions. Each question can be answered by querying just one table. Part of your job as an Analyst is figuring out which table to use.
